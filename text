--------Functional Test-------
A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
When a user [does something with some parameters], [some thing should happen]

- When the shopping cart is empty, it should be obvious that there are no items in the cart from UI standpoint.
- When the user still clicks on the empty cart icon, display a page that says, "Your cart is empty" and direct them what to do next such as browse your saved items or back to home.
- When a user is already logged in, only show "Proceed to checkout" when a user clicks on the cart.
- If a user is not logged in, give the user options to create a new account, log in, and/or checkout as a guest.
- On that same page, display fields to fill out shipping address.
- For check out as a guest option, have the user type in their email address only. 
- At the top of the page, show a tracker so users know what steps are invloved. ex) Ship or Pick up --> Delivery --> Payment
- Display error messages, if the user forgets to type in an email address or other required info.
